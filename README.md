This Python project demonstrates the creation of a virtual keyboard that can be controlled using hand gestures. The virtual keyboard can be a handy tool for hands-free typing in various applications. It's built using Python, OpenCV for hand tracking, and can be extended for different use cases.

Features
Hand Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV and the cvzone library for hand tracking and recognizing gestures.

Virtual Keyboard: Provides a virtual keyboard on-screen with different keys for each finger gesture.

Gesture Control: Presses keys when your hand's finger approaches a key, enabling hands-free typing.

Text Display: Displays the typed text in real-time on the screen.

Customization: Easy customization of the virtual keyboard layout and appearance.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
cvzone library
pynput library

Getting Started
